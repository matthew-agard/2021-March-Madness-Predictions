    "# Creating the Perfect Bracket\n",
    "\n",
    "There's nothing quite like the most riveting basketball event of the year: NCAA March Madness. The 64-team tournament consists of 4 regions, each with 16 teams ranked independently of the other regions according to their regular season performance. Each team attempts to win 6 successive games in order to emerge victorious as the NCAA national champion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps what contributes most to the intrigue of March Madness is filling out a March Madness bracket. \"The American Gaming Association estimated in 2019 that 40 million Americans filled out a combined 149 million brackets for a collective wager of \\$4.6 billion.\" It's important to note that even a single bet can be quite lucrative, particularly when an upset occurs (when a lower-ranking underdog beats a higher-ranking favorite). For example, the first-ever upset of a #1 seed by a #16 seed occurred in the 2019 NCAA tournament. In that game \"a \\$100 bet paid out \\$2,500\", which translates to American betting odds of +2500!\n",

    "\n",
    "The purpose of this personal project is to perform supervised classification on March Madness data to more accurately predict the outcome of an NCAA tournament games--particularly the occurrence of upsets. This would allow for an increased possibility of yielding the kinds of profits mentioned above by filling out more accurate brackets."

    "1) What is a bracket's accuracy given random guessing (always choosing the higher-ranked team) \\[and show trend over time]?\n",
    "\n",
    "2) How often do upsets occur in a given year's March Madness? \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "5) Does your data have any null values? Are these values missing at random?"
